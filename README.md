# Starlink Python

![Status: Pre-Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pre--alpha-orange)

A Python library for loading data from a [SpaceX Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/e) satellite.

I'm writing this in order to create a Home Assistant component for Starlink -- see 

I currently have the first iteration of Starlink satellites and am developing with this. Feel free to create an issue if you have a second iteration and want to help add support for this.
